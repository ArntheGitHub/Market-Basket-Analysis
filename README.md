# Market-Basket-Analysis

Project description 

 The manager of a grocery store asked for my help regarding the shelf layout of the shop. Until recently they had about 200 SKUs (stock keeping units: unique item numbers), but the headquarter of the grocery chain advised them to keep only 105 of them and introduce 64 new SKUs. The store manager is in charge of where to place those items. 
 
 The 105 existing items were distributed evenly across the 7 shelves. In general everything can be changed, but the store manager suggests to keep those 105 items at their current position, unless there are very strong reasons for an alternative. Otherwise the customers could be even more confused than they will be anyway due to the change.  
 
 I have been given sales data from a different shop that made the transition last year. The layout of this shop is somewhat different, but i can get from the data, which items were purchased together and which not.  
 
 My task is to perform smart analysis with the data using Python code and come up with a good recommendation for the store manager.  
 
The Data set contains:  

-9835 rows 

-Each row is a transaction (customer basket) 

-The items purchased in each row are separated by commas 

-169 unique items
